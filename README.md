# Testing Locally

1. Install Ruby
  - note: this is painful on a Mac M1, consider [ruby on mac](https://www.rubyonmac.dev/) to automate the process
  - gem install rexml
2. [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
3. `jekyll serve` from the project root. This will automatically rebuild the site as you make changes. However, note that changes to `_config.yml` require a server restart.
